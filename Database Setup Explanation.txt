HOW TO SET UP DATABASE ADVERTS FOR EACH SERVER

After running the plugin the first time, it will create a database. As each server runs the plugin, they create a new column in the database that is: IP_PORT.

Any setup (row) you make is enabled (1) or disabled (0) by putting a 1 or 0 in the column with that servers IP_PORT.

When you insert a row:
	id							Leave this blank. It will be added automatically
	svrmsg						Put the server message (advertisement) here. See below for color codes.
	msgorder					Optional. Put in numbers for each setup here to order them.
	12.345.67.890_270215		A column like this is added for each server that runs the plugin. Put a 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled) in a servers column to enable this add on that server.


COLOR SETTINGS EXPLANATION:

For most games (CS:GO and Insurgency being exceptions), use the following to set colors at any point in the message:

	{COLOR:XXXXXX}				where XXXXXX is a color hex code, which can be generated by websites such as: http:www.colorpicker.com/

	e.g. In `svrmsg`, you could put:
		{COLOR:FFFFFF}This is my {COLOR:FF0000}advertisement{COLOR:FFFFFF} message!
	This would create a white message with advertisement being red.


For CS:GO:

	Use {COLOR:XX}, where XX is from the following list:
	
		01 - White                	02 - Dark Red         03 - Team Colors or Lavender      04 - Lime Green
		05 - Light Green		    06 - Olive            07 - Light Red            		08 - Grey
		09 - Yellow              	10 - Light Blue       11 - Blue                			12 - Dark Blue
		13 - Another Blue        	14 - Purple           15 - Orange Red					16 - Orange (Note: This one has been known to cause formatting issues at times)

		
For Insurgency:

	Use {COLOR:XX}, where XX is from the following list:		

		01 - White                02 - Team Colors          03 - Lime Green          04 - Light Green
		05 - Olive Black          06 - Banana Yellow        07 - Dark Yellow         08 - Grey
