# TOGs Database Adverts
(togsdbadverts)

Custom server announcements and colors, controlled via databases.

* Colors work with Source 2009 games supporting hex (CS:S, TF2, etc.), CS:GO, and Insurgency.
* Configurable for frequency of adverts.
* The database setups can each be made for specific server(s), or apply to all servers, and ordered by another column.


## Installation:
* Put togsdbadverts.smx in the following folder: /addons/sourcemod/plugins/

## CVars:

</details>


Note: After changing the cvars in your cfg file, be sure to rcon the new values to the server so that they take effect immediately.
